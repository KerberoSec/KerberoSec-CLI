## Introduction

This writeup covers the **Neighbour** room on TryHackMe, a beginner-level web challenge focused on insecure direct object references (IDOR). The lab is short, practical, and highlights how simple authorization flaws can lead to unintended data exposure.

## Initial Reconnaissance

Even though this is an IDOR-focused room, I started with a quick Nmap scan to check exposed services.

```
~$ nmap -sV 10.49.151.21
```

The scan completed cleanly and confirmed that the host was reachable. Only two TCP ports were open.

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.53
```
SSH was open, but the web service on port 80 was clearly the main attack surface.

## Web Exploitation

I navigated to the web application running on port 80 and was presented with a simple login interface.

</div>

At first glance, the page looked intentionally minimal. One detail stood out immediately: a message below the login form referencing a **guest account**, along with a hint to inspect the page source (`Ctrl+U`) .

Opening the source code revealed a commented line that hadn’t been removed during development:

```
<!-- use guest:guest credentials until registration is fixed. "admin" user account is off limits!!!!! -->
```

That single comment explained the next step without needing any guesswork. I logged in using the provided guest credentials.

Once authenticated, I was redirected to a profile page associated with the guest user.

## Capturing the Flag

While reviewing the page, I noticed the structure of the URL in the address bar:

```
http://10.49.151.21/profile.php?user=guest
```

The application was directly referencing the username as a request parameter. I modified the value of the `user` parameter in the URL and loaded the page again.

The response changed immediately, and the protected content became visible. The flag was displayed directly on the page.

```
flag{66be95c478473d91a5358f2440c7af1f}
```
