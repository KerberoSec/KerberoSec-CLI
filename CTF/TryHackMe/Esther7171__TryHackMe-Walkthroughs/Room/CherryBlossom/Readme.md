We found number of running services

## Smb Enemuration

Let map smb
```
death@esther:~$ smbclient -L 10.48.176.208
Password for [WORKGROUP\death]:
Anonymous login successful

	Sharename       Type      Comment

SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```
We have a sharename Anonymous, lets try to access this share
When it prompts you for a password, just hit the enter key and you’ll be logged in.

cool, we are logged in. We can go ahead and look for files that are available on this server

```
death@esther:~$ smbclient //10.48.176.208/anonymous

		10253588 blocks of size 1024. 4680260 blocks available
smb: \> get journal.txt 
getting file \journal.txt of size 3470998 as journal.txt (4195.1 KiloBytes/sec) (average 4195.1 KiloBytes/sec)
smb: \>
```
There’s a journal.txt file on the server. Lets download this to our machine using the get command.

command:get journal.txt

We have successfully downloaded the file to our machine. 

The next step now is analyzing the journal.txt file we got from the smb server.i copy the content and past this at cyberchef and got to know this is na pnd converted into base64 format
<img width="1913" height="964" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c5be878-c7f3-4793-ae45-a1be668e7428" />

So what we can do is decode the base64 encoding into an image.
```
cat journal.txt | base64 -d > output.png
```

<img width="649" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eddad51d-d14f-48d9-b9f8-05def3ef3ae5" />

we got our output file and its a cherryblosm tree image

the wired part is the image is not even hd still consuming 2.5m of space
let use stegpy 
```
pip3 install --user stegpy --break-system-packages
```
this util not working so i left  in frustruation
