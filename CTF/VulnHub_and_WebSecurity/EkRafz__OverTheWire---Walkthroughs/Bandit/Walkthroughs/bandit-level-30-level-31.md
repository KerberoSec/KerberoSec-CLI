## Commands Used

- `git clone`: Copy a remote repository to your local machine
- `git log`: Show the commit history
- `git branch -a`: List all branches including remote-tracking
- `git tag`: List tags
- `git show`: Show the contents of a tag or commit
- `cat`: Print file contents to the terminal

## Solution

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Run this on your **local machine**:

```bash
$ git clone ssh://bandit30-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:2220/home/bandit30-git/repo
$ cd repo
```

Enter the `bandit30` password when prompted.

---

### Step 2: Check the Obvious Places First

```bash
$ cat README.md
just an empty file... muahaha
```

```bash
$ git log --oneline
bd393e0 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) initial commit of README.md
```

One commit, nothing useful. Check branches:

```bash
$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
```

Only one branch. Commits and branches are dead ends. The password is hidden somewhere else.

### Understand git Tags

A **tag** is a named reference to a specific point in git history: most commonly used to mark release versions (e.g. `v1.0.0`). Unlike branches, tags do not move as new commits are added; they are fixed labels.

There are two kinds of tags:

|Type|What it is|
|---|---|
|**Lightweight tag**|A plain pointer to a commit: just a name and a hash, nothing else.|
|**Annotated tag**|A full git object with its own message, author, date, and optionally a GPG signature. Can store arbitrary data in the message.|

Tags are not transferred by `git clone` automatically in the same way branches are, but `git clone` does fetch them. They are simply easy to overlook because they do not show up in `git log` or `git branch -a`.

|Command|What it does|
|---|---|
|`git tag`|Lists all tags in the repository.|
|`git show <tagname>`|Shows the tag's message and the commit it points to. For annotated tags, the message can contain arbitrary content.|

---

### Step 3: List Tags

```bash
$ git tag
secret
```

One tag: `secret`.

---

### Step 4: Show the Tag

```bash
$ git show secret
```

For an annotated tag this prints the tag message before the commit details. The output will look like:

```
<password>
```

The password is stored directly in the tag's message.

That is the password for [Bandit Level 31 → Level 32](bandit-level-31-level-32.md).

## Key Takeaways

- **`git tag`** is the third place to check in a repository after commits and branches. Tags are easy to overlook: they appear in neither `git log` nor `git branch -a`.
- **Annotated tags carry a message** that can contain arbitrary text. They are git objects in their own right, not just pointers. `git show <tagname>` reveals that message.
- The search order for secrets in a git repository is now complete across these four levels: **working tree files → commit history → branches → tags**. A stash (`git stash list`) rounds out the list but was not needed here.
- Tags are commonly used in real repositories to mark releases. An annotated tag on a release commit is a plausible place for a developer to leave a note: including one they should not have.
