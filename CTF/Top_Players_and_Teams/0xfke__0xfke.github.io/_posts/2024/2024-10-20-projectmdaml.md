## Static Analysis using API

The **Static Analysis using API** component provides a fast and effective way to analyze files, URLs, and hashes by leveraging the VirusTotal API. This feature allows users to submit files or URLs and receive detailed threat intelligence, enhancing their ability to quickly identify potential security risks.

---

### Technologies Used by Static

This module uses the following technologies:

- **Flask**
- **VirusTotal API**
- **Python**
- **requests**

---

### File Types Supported by Static

The tool supports the following file types for static analysis:

- **Files**: all
- **Other supported formats**: File hashs and URLs compatible with VirusTotal API

---

---

### How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user uploads a file or provides a URL for analysis.
2. **VirusTotal API Integration**: The application sends the file or URL to VirusTotal's API to fetch any associated threat intelligence data.
3. **Result Display**: The retrieved information is processed and displayed on the results page, which includes:
    - **Scan Date**: Date of the last scan for the submitted file/URL.
    - **Detection Ratio**: Ratio of the VirusTotal engines that detected a threat.
    - **Detailed Results**: A breakdown of results from different scanning engines.

---

### Benefits of Static Analysis using API

- **Quick Detection**: Allows immediate scanning using a reliable external threat database.
- **Automated Insights**: Fetches relevant intelligence data without requiring manual lookup.
- **Comprehensive Detection**: Aggregates results from multiple sources to improve detection accuracy.

This tool integrates two key methods to detect potential threats, providing users with a comprehensive approach to assess security risks.

## Machine Learning-Based Detection

The **Machine Learning-Based Detection** component leverages a machine learning model trained to detect malicious behavior in executable files. By focusing on feature extraction from Portable Executable (PE) headers, this tool offers an advanced, ML-powered approach to identify malware within `.exe` and `.dll` files.

---

### Technologies Used by ML

This module uses the following technologies:

- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Flask**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **pefile**
- **Joblib**
---

### Feature Selection and Model Training

The model focuses on the most important features extracted from the PE headers of executable files. Here’s an overview of the key processes:

1. **Feature Extraction**: PE header features are extracted from each file to create the feature set.
2. **Feature Selection**: Important features are selected based on importance scores from a Random Forest Classifier. Only the most relevant features are retained to optimize model accuracy.
3. **Model Training**: A Random Forest model is trained on the filtered feature set, allowing it to distinguish between benign and malicious executables with high precision.

**Model Performance**  

| Metric         | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Accuracy |
|----------------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Benign**     | 1.00      | 0.97   | 0.98     | 1003     |
| **Malware**    | 0.99      | 1.00   | 0.99     | 2920     |
| **Overall**    | -         | -      | -        | 99%      |

### File Types Supported

This feature is specifically designed for the following file types:

- **Executable files**: `.exe`, `.dll`

### How It Works

1. **File Upload**: The user uploads an executable file (.exe or .dll) for ML-based analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The system extracts PE header features and selects only the most important features based on prior analysis.
3. **Model Prediction**: The Random Forest model uses the extracted features to predict if the file is benign or malicious.
4. **Result Display**: The application displays the result on a user-friendly interface, including probability scores and model confidence.

### Benefits of Machine Learning-Based Detection

- **High Precision**: The model achieves high accuracy in detecting malware, minimizing false positives.
- **Automated Feature Selection**: Uses the most relevant features for analysis, improving both speed and accuracy.
- **Focused Detection**: Designed specifically for executables, ensuring optimized and reliable detection for a key threat vector.

This ML-based approach complements the static analysis, providing a comprehensive toolkit for malware detection.

## Feature Selection and Model Training

### Selection of Features According to Their Importances

Using a Random Forest Classifier, we evaluated the importance of different features to identify the most significant ones for malware detection. By filtering the features based on their importances, we set a threshold to select only the most relevant features for training our model. This approach enhances the model's efficiency and accuracy.

### Training a New Model Based on Important Features

After selecting the important features, we trained a new model, which yielded the following classification metrics:

| Class    | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Benign   | 1.00      | 0.97   | 0.98     | 1003    |
| Malware  | 0.99      | 1.00   | 0.99     | 2920    |
| **Accuracy**     | **0.99**  |        |          | **3923**    |
| Macro Avg| 0.99      | 0.98   | 0.99     | 3923    |
| Weighted Avg| 0.99   | 0.99   | 0.99     | 3923    |

**Training Scores:**  
The average training score is approximately 99.13%.

**Validation Scores:**  
The average validation score is around 98.63%.

The results demonstrate high performance for both training and validation sets, with only a slight discrepancy of 0.51%.

### Analysis

- **No Overfitting:** The close alignment of training and validation scores indicates that the model is likely not overfitting. In cases of significant overfitting, we would expect a higher training score compared to the validation score.
  
- **Slight Underfitting Possibility:** While the validation score is marginally lower than the training score, indicating a slight potential for underfitting, the difference is minimal.

### Learning Curves

To assess the model's performance over different training set sizes, we generated learning curves. These curves help visualize how the model's accuracy evolves as more training data is added.

### Training and Validation Scores by Training Set Size

The bar chart below displays the average training and validation scores along with their standard deviations across various training set sizes.

By analyzing these scores and visualizations, we gain insight into the model's learning behavior and can make informed decisions for further improvements.
