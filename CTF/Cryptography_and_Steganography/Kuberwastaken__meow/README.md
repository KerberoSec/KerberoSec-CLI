## Wait- What? You Can Just Make File Formats?

<table>
<tr>
<td width="70%">

Well- yes, but no, I'll come to that bit later, but before that, let me geek out about what this project is

**MEOW** (Metadata Encoded Optimized Webfile) is a Python-based image file format designed to be efficient, practical, and cross-platform compatible. 

With support for RGBA transparency, metadata, and fast rendering capabilities, MEOW provides a modern alternative for image storage and manipulation.

Whether you're a developer looking for a lightweight image format, an AI locked-in person to use the best possible file fomat, a digital artist needing transparent image support, or just a curious coder who wants a .meow file extension, MEOW offers a simple yet powerful solution.

## Why is it called MEOW?

## The Problem with "Innovative" File Formats

**MEOW** started off as just a fun, new (very ineffecient) image file format I made studying about them as a meme while having better metadata to be used with AI, but I realised something.

People don't make new file formats simply because of one problem- they're very hard to bring to mass adoption, what if we fix that?

## Cross-Compatibility With PNGs

MEOW uses a steganographic image format that embeds metadata that's needed for AI workflows while maintaining PNG compatibility. It's basically PNGs on Steroids.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="60%">

### How it's less of a headache
Unlike traditional formats that require special viewers, **MEOW files contain standard PNG data**:

- ✅ **Works in ANY image viewer** after simple setup (2 options below)
- ✅ **Option 1: Rename to `.png`**: instant compatibility everywhere
- ✅ **Option 2: File association setup**: makes `.meow` extension recognized  
- ✅ **Hidden AI data** invisible to standard viewers, visible to AI
- ✅ **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Setup Required**: Either rename `.meow` → `.png` OR run file association scripts

</td>
<td width="40%" align="center">

```
📱 Standard Viewer (Setup Required)
   ↓ Method 1: Rename test.meow → test.png
   ↓ Method 2: Run file association script
🖼️ Result: Opens as beautiful PNG image

🤖 AI-Aware App  
   ↓ Opens .meow file directly (or renamed .png)
🧠 Sees: Image + Rich AI metadata
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Perfect for AI Applications

MEOW is specifically designed for use with AI, embedding metadata that is really useful for machine learning workflows and potentially can enhance LLM image understanding

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

#### Problems with Current Formats
- **Metadata can very easily be stripped**: when images are processed or shared: this is usually for security but is a bad tradeoff for AI
- **Limited to basic descriptive information**: not optimized for machine learning
- **Separate from actual image processing**: requires additional steps
- **Not designed for machine learning workflows**

</td>
<td width="50%">

#### Performance Benefits
- **Reduced preprocessing time** with embedded parameters
- **Training data enrichment** with embedded annotations and other data
- **Enhanced LLM understanding** with structured metadata and features like attention maps
- **Multimodal AI acceleration** for vision-language models, no need for seperate JSONs now

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## MEOW's AI-Optimized Advantages

MEOW embeds AI-specific parameters that traditional formats can't (or well, can with a ton of modification can) handle. When any image is converted to a .meow, this data is automatically added in the conversion process:

1. **Pre-computed AI Features**
  *   Optimal preprocessing parameters embedded in the file
  *   Attention maps showing where AI models should focus
  *   Bounding boxes and object detection data
  *   Saliency regions for computer vision tasks

2.  **Model Optimization Data**

3.  **Steganographic Storage**

  Unlike traditional metadata that's easily lost:

  *   Encoded in pixel LSBs (Least Significant Bits)
  *   Survives file operations that would strip normal metadata
  *   Invisible to standard viewers but accessible to AI applications

## How Steganographic Storage Works

MEOW uses **LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography** to hide AI data inside standard PNG images:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="60%">

### The Technical Magic
1. **Load standard PNG image** into memory
2. **Compress AI metadata** using compression
3. **Hide data in pixel LSBs** (2 bits per RGB channel = 6 bits/pixel)
4. **Save as PNG** with `.meow` extension
5. **Result**: Perfect PNG that works everywhere + hidden AI data

### Storage Specifications
- **The Magic Header**: `MEOW_STEG_V2` (12 bytes)
- **Capacity**: 6 bits per pixel (RGB channels only)
- **Compression**: zlib level 9 for maximum efficiency
- **Overhead**: Typically 15-25% of original file size

</td>
<td width="40%">

```
Original Pixel: [R, G, B, A]
                [142, 87, 203, 255]

After Hiding Data:
                [R, G, B, A]  
                [140, 84, 200, 255]
                 ↑    ↑    ↑
            Changed by 2 bits max
            (Visually imperceptible)
```

**Data Structure:**

### Why Steganographic MEOW Is Awesome Here

**The Problem**: AI-enhanced formats typically sacrifice compatibility for features  
**The Solution**: Hide AI data inside universally-compatible PNG files  
**The Result**: Best of both worlds: works everywhere + AI superpowers

> **⚠️ Important**: While MEOW files contain standard PNG data, you need either:
> 1. **Rename `.meow` → `.png`** (compatibility for viewing), OR  
> 2. **Run file association scripts** (one-time setup to make `.meow` extension recognized)
> 
> Without setup, most viewers won't recognize the `.meow` extension by default. Because well, I just made it lol.

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 📦 Setup
```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kuberwastaken/meow.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd meow

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up file associations (optional)
windows\associate_meow.bat  # Run as administrator
```

### 🔄 Creating MEOW Files

#### Command Line: Quick Conversion
```powershell
# Convert any image to steganographic MEOW
python meow_format.py image.jpg output.meow

# Convert PNG with rich AI annotations
python convert.py image.png enhanced.meow
```

#### GUI Application: Full Featured
```powershell
# Launch the MEOW GUI with AI features
python meow_gui.py
```

### 👁️ Viewing & Testing Cross-Compatibility

#### Standard Image Viewers (2 Setup Options)
```powershell
# Option 1: Rename to .png (works instantly everywhere)
rename test.meow test.png
start test.png                    # Opens in default viewer

# Option 2: Set up file associations (makes .meow recognized)
windows\associate_meow.bat        # Run as administrator first
start test.meow                   # Now opens directly!
```

#### MEOW-Aware Applications (See AI Data)
```powershell
# Launch MEOW viewer to see hidden AI metadata
python meow_gui.py

# Run compatibility demonstration
python final_demonstration.py
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example

```powershell
# 1. Create a steganographic MEOW file
python meow_format.py "photo.jpg" "photo.meow"

# 2. Test universal compatibility - Choose your method:

# Method A: Rename to PNG (instant compatibility)
copy photo.meow photo.png          # Keep original + create PNG copy
start photo.png                    # Opens in any image viewer!

# Method B: File association setup (one-time setup)
windows\associate_meow.bat         # Run as admin (one-time setup)
start photo.meow                   # Now .meow files open directly!

# 3. Extract AI data (MEOW-aware apps see hidden metadata)
python meow_gui.py                 # Load .meow OR renamed .png - AI data intact!
```

## 🕴️ Next Steps

### File Association Setup

To make `.meow` files open directly in your system's default image viewer, run the appropriate setup script for your platform:

#### Windows
```powershell
# Run as administrator to set up file associations
windows\associate_meow.bat
```

#### macOS  
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x macos/associate_meow_macos.sh
./macos/associate_meow_macos.sh
```

#### Linux/Cross-Platform
```bash
# Universal setup script that detects your OS
chmod +x scripts/associate_meow_crossplatform.sh
./scripts/associate_meow_crossplatform.sh
```

After running the appropriate script, double-clicking any `.meow` file will open it in your system's default image viewer (Paint, Preview, etc.) while preserving the hidden AI metadata for MEOW-aware applications.

**Note**: File association is optional: you can always rename `.meow` files to `.png` for instant compatibility with any image viewer.
