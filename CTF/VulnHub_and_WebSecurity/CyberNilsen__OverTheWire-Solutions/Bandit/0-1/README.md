# 🔁 Bandit Level 0 → Level 1

First I read the task at hand:

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

Then I proceeded to log in. I tried `ls`, which showed that the `readme` file was in the same directory I was currently in. Then I just wrote `cat readme` and got the password for the next level.

```
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
