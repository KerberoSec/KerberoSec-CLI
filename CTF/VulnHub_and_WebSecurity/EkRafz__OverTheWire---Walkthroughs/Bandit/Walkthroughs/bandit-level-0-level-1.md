## Commands Used

- `ssh`: Connect to remote machines securely
- `ls`: List directory contents
- `cat`: Print file contents to the terminal

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Connect to the Server

If you haven't used SSH before, see [How to connect to the server](how-to-connect-to-the-server.md) for a full explanation.

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

---

### Step 2: Enter the Password

You'll reach the login prompt:

```
bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:
```

Enter `bandit0`. The password won't be visible as you type: that's normal.

---

### Step 3: Find the Password File

Once logged in, list the current directory:

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
```

There is one file named `readme`. Read it:

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
```

The file contains the password for [Bandit Level 1 → Level 2](bandit-level-1-level-2.md).

---

### Step 4: Save the Password and Exit

> **Warning:** OverTheWire does not remember your progress. Copy the password now with **`Ctrl + Shift + C`** before closing the session.

> **Note:** Per [OverTheWire's rules](https://overthewire.org/rules/), passwords are not published in walkthroughs.

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ exit
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- `ls` lists the files in your current directory: always the first thing to run when you log in.
- `cat <filename>` prints a file's contents to the terminal.
- SSH passwords are invisible as you type: this is normal behaviour, not a bug.
