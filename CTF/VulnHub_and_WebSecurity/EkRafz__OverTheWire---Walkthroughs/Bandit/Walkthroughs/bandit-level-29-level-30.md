## Commands Used

- `git clone`: Copy a remote repository to your local machine
- `git log`: Show the commit history
- `git branch`: List branches
- `git checkout`: Switch to a different branch
- `cat`: Print file contents to the terminal

## Solution

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Run this on your **local machine**:

```bash
$ git clone ssh://bandit29-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:2220/home/bandit29-git/repo
$ cd repo
```

Enter the `bandit29` password when prompted.

---

### Step 2: Read the Current File

```bash
$ cat README.md
# Bandit Notes
Some notes for level30 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit30
- password: <no passwords in production!>
```

The note says no passwords in production. That phrasing is a hint: the password may exist in a non-production branch.

---

### Step 3: Check the Commit History

```bash
$ git log
```

Only a handful of commits, none with suspicious messages like the `fix info leak` from last level. The history on this branch is clean: the password was never here.

---

### Understand git Branches

A **branch** is an independent line of development within a repository. The default branch is typically called `main` or `master`. Repositories often have additional branches for features, testing, or development work that is kept separate from production.

`git clone` checks out the default branch but downloads references to all remote branches. Those branches exist on the remote and are visible locally as **remote-tracking branches**: they are not automatically checked out, but you can list and switch to them.

|Command|What it does|
|---|---|
|`git branch`|Lists local branches only.|
|`git branch -a`|Lists all branches: local and remote-tracking.|
|`git checkout <branch>`|Switches to a branch, creating a local copy of a remote branch if needed.|

---

### Step 4: List All Branches

```bash
$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/sploits-dev
```

Two non-default remote branches: `dev` and `sploits-dev`. Given the hint about production, `dev` is the obvious place to look.

---

### Step 5: Switch to the dev Branch

```bash
$ git checkout dev
Branch 'dev' set up to track 'origin/dev'.
Switched to a new branch 'dev'
```

---

### Step 6: Read the File

```bash
$ cat README.md
# Bandit Notes
Some notes for level30 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit30
- password: <password>
```

The password is present on the `dev` branch.

That is the password for [Bandit Level 30 → Level 31](bandit-level-30-level-31.md).

## Key Takeaways

- **Branches are independent lines of development.** The default branch is not the only place to look: sensitive data is often committed to feature or development branches that were never intended to be public, but are still part of the cloned repository.
- **`git branch -a`** is the first command to run when the current branch yields nothing. The `-a` flag is essential: without it, remote-tracking branches are invisible.
- **`git checkout <branch>`** switches context entirely. Files, history, and `git log` output all reflect the checked-out branch, not the one you started on.
- The "no passwords in production" note is a real-world pattern: developers sometimes treat non-production branches as lower-security, committing credentials they would never put on `main`. Those branches are still in the repository and fully accessible to anyone who clones it.
- Combined with the previous level: git history (commits) and git structure (branches) are both worth searching. Later levels add tags and stashes to that list.
