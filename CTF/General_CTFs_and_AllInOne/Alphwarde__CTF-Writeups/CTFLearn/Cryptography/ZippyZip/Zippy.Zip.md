## My Approach and Thought Process  

### Step 1: Extracting the ZIP File  
I started by first unzipping the provided file:

Upon extraction, I found a large number of zip files, making it difficult to check them all manually. However, I attempted it anyway:

### Step 2: Analyzing Password Protection  
At this point, I realized what the challenge meant by **"a very very STRONG password."**  
I tried common passwords like `Zippy` and `ZippyZip`, including various combinations, but none worked.  

This led me to consider two possibilities:  
- The phrase **"very very STRONG"** might be sarcasm.  
- The key to solving the challenge might not lie in manually unzipping the files.  

### Step 3: Cracking the ZIP Passwords  
At this point, I decided to try cracking the ZIP files' passwords using a tool named `zip-crc-cracker`.  
To install it, I ran:  
`git clone https://github.com/kmyk/zip-crc-cracker`

## My Solution:
I ran the following command with all the file names:
`python crack.py`

- **I found the flag**
