## Introduction
Love Letter Locker is a web-based challenge focused on IDOR. While interacting with the application, I identified how predictable identifiers could be manipulated to access other users’ letters.

## Initial Reconnaissance

The room provides a direct entry point to the web application:

</div>

I started by navigating to the target in the browser to understand how the application behaves.

</div>

The landing page presents two basic options: account creation and login. Since no credentials were provided, I proceeded by creating a new account.

</div>

After registering successfully, I logged into the application.

</div>

Once inside, I landed on a dashboard that showed my letters along with a small hint:

“Every love letter gets a unique number in the archive. Numbers make everything easier to find.”

It also displayed the total number of letters currently in the system.

</div>

## Exploring Functionality

To understand how the application handles user data, I created a new letter.

<div align='center'>[
  <img width="1913" height="597" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4ceced5-99fa-4540-91dd-166ed0a6d7af" />
</div>

The letter was created successfully, and I was able to open it.

<div align='center'>[
  <img width="966" height="557" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e03cf441-f09a-4d2e-80af-1f560630db82" />
</div>

To inspect things more closely, I opened the letter in a new tab and focused on the URL structure.

<div align='center'>[
  <img width="1915" height="479" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b8c988c-93aa-408e-b3a8-6682078983ee" />
</div>

The URL contained a numeric identifier for the letter. Mine was assigned the number 3. That immediately stood out, especially considering the earlier hint about unique numbers.

## Accessing Other Letters
At this point, I tested whether the application properly restricts access to other users’ data. I modified the letter ID directly in the URL.

First, I switched from `3` to `2`.

<div align='center'>[

</div>

The application returned another letter without any restriction.

Next, I changed the ID to `1`.

</div>

This time, I was able to access a different letter, which revealed the flag.

Conclusion

This room demonstrates how predictable identifiers in web applications can expose sensitive data when proper access controls are missing.
