The complexity of level by level is gradually increasing...
![Bandit5](https://github.com/sreekesari-vangeepuram/overthewire/blob/master/overthewire/bandit/bandit5/level5-%3Elevel6.png)

These are design by very cool brains! It's really developing beginners like us.
Let's see what we have to do here!

```
bandit5@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit5@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
maybehere00  maybehere02  maybehere04  maybehere06  maybehere08  maybehere10  maybehere12  maybehere14  maybehere16  maybehere18
maybehere01  maybehere03  maybehere05  maybehere07  maybehere09  maybehere11  maybehere13  maybehere15  maybehere17  maybehere19
```

Cool we got some directories; LOL!
More challenging let's try this:
```
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find ./ -type f -size 1033c ! -executable 
./maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2

                                                 bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$

Oooooh! What's that?
FIND?

So actually `find` is a very powerful command in Uinx or Unix-like systems!

Let's see what does it do:
```
$ find --help
Usage: find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-Olevel] [-D debugopts] [path...] [expression]

default path is the current directory; default expression is -print
expression may consist of: operators, options, tests, and actions:
operators (decreasing precedence; -and is implicit where no others are given):
      ( EXPR )   ! EXPR   -not EXPR   EXPR1 -a EXPR2   EXPR1 -and EXPR2
      EXPR1 -o EXPR2   EXPR1 -or EXPR2   EXPR1 , EXPR2
positional options (always true): -daystart -follow -regextype

normal options (always true, specified before other expressions):
      -depth --help -maxdepth LEVELS -mindepth LEVELS -mount -noleaf
      --version -xdev -ignore_readdir_race -noignore_readdir_race
tests (N can be +N or -N or N): -amin N -anewer FILE -atime N -cmin N
      -cnewer FILE -ctime N -empty -false -fstype TYPE -gid N -group NAME
      -ilname PATTERN -iname PATTERN -inum N -iwholename PATTERN -iregex PATTERN
      -links N -lname PATTERN -mmin N -mtime N -name PATTERN -newer FILE
      -nouser -nogroup -path PATTERN -perm [-/]MODE -regex PATTERN
      -readable -writable -executable
      -wholename PATTERN -size N[bcwkMG] -true -type [bcdpflsD] -uid N
      -used N -user NAME -xtype [bcdpfls]      -context CONTEXT

actions: -delete -print0 -printf FORMAT -fprintf FILE FORMAT -print 
      -fprint0 FILE -fprint FILE -ls -fls FILE -prune -quit
      -exec COMMAND ; -exec COMMAND {} + -ok COMMAND ;
      -execdir COMMAND ; -execdir COMMAND {} + -okdir COMMAND ;

Valid arguments for -D:
exec, opt, rates, search, stat, time, tree, all, help
Use '-D help' for a description of the options, or see find(1)

Please see also the documentation at http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/.
You can report (and track progress on fixing) bugs in the "find"
program via the GNU findutils bug-reporting page at
https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=findutils or, if
you have no web access, by sending email to <bug-findutils@gnu.org>.
```
So, `find` is a powerful tool for us to simply get a file at a location in our file-system by simply specifying it's properties.
Cool, right!

Hope you've learnt something new from this [if you don't know this before/didn't strike to you during the start].

Now, let's use the password `DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7` to log into the remote-machine as `bandit6`.

**Warning: Please, first try Level 6 -> Level 7! Otherwise it's useless to simply cpy-pst the command[s]/password[s].
