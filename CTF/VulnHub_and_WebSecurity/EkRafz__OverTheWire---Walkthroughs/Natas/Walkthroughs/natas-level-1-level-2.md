## Tools Used

- A web browser
- **View Page Source**: read the raw HTML the server sent
- **Directory listing**: browsing a server directory directly in the browser

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Open the URL

Navigate to `http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org` and log in with the password from Level 1.

The page displays:

```
There is nothing on this page.
```

View the source with `Ctrl + U`. This time there is no comment containing the password, but there is an `<img>` tag:

```html

```

The page loads an image from a subdirectory called `files/`. That directory exists on the server.

---

### Understand Directory Listing

Web servers store files in directories, just like your local filesystem. When you request a file by URL, the server returns that file. But if you request a **directory** URL and the server has not placed an `index.html` inside it, many servers will instead return a **directory listing**: a plain page showing every file in that folder.

This is a misconfiguration. A directory listing exposes the full contents of a folder to anyone who knows, or guesses: the path. Developers often forget that uploading an image or a script also makes the entire containing directory browsable.

---

### Step 2: Browse the Directory

Remove `pixel.png` from the URL and navigate directly to the directory:

```
http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/
```

The server returns a directory listing:

```
Index of /files
pixel.png
users.txt
```

`users.txt` should not be publicly accessible, but it is.

---

### Step 3: Open users.txt

Navigate to:

```
http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/users.txt
```

The file contains a list of usernames and passwords. Find the entry for `natas3`:

```
natas3:<password>
```

That is the password for [Natas Level 2 → 3](natas-level-2-level-3.md).

## Key Takeaways

- **Page source reveals more than just the visible content.** Referenced assets: images, scripts, stylesheets: point to paths on the server worth exploring.
- **Directory listing is a misconfiguration**, not a feature. If a directory has no `index.html`, many servers expose its full contents by default. It should be explicitly disabled in production.
- **Every path in a URL is a potential attack surface.** If you can reach `files/pixel.png`, you can try `files/`: the server decides what to show, and misconfigured servers show everything.
