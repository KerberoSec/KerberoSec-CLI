![The help screen for Devious-WinRM, showing a variety of flags and options.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1upbyte/Devious-WinRM/refs/heads/main/assets/help-screen.png "Help screen")

## Highlight Features
### Zero-confing Kerberos
Devious-WinRM's initial reason for creation was due to how complicated Kerberos auth can be. With Devious-WinRM, on most operating systems, it is as simple as appending the `-k` flag to the command line. Devious-WinRM will automatically handle the rest.

### Easy in-memory .NET execution
Any .NET binary can be ran directly in the Powershell process' memory using the [invoke](https://github.com/1upbyte/Devious-WinRM/wiki/2-%E2%80%90-Usage-Guide#invoke) command, usually **bypassing AV detection**. It's quick-and-easy way to covertly execute binaries without touching disk.

### Local token upgrader
Some commands, such as `Get-Service` or `qwinsta` will fail to execute via WinRM due to a permission error. Devious-WinRM leverages RunasCs for an effortless way to get around this limitation of WinRM. Simply prepending the desired command with [localexec](https://github.com/1upbyte/Devious-WinRM/wiki/2-%E2%80%90-Usage-Guide#localexec) will work.
