## Commands Used

- `ssh`: Connect to remote machines securely
- `ls`: List directory contents
- `cat`: Print file contents to the terminal
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory
- `Ctrl + C`: Interrupt a running command and return to the prompt
- `Ctrl + Shift + C`: Copy selected text in the terminal

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Connect to the Server

If you haven't used SSH before, see [How to connect to the server](how-to-connect-to-the-server.md) for a full explanation.

```bash
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Use the password you found at the end of [Bandit Level 0 → Level 1](bandit-level-0-level-1.md).

---

### Step 2: List the Home Directory

Once logged in, run `ls` to see what's there:

```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ ls
-
```

There is one file, and its name is `-`. This is where the challenge starts: `-` is a special character in the terminal and can't be used directly as a filename argument.

---

### Step 3: The Problem with `cat -`

Your first instinct might be to run:

```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat -
```

This won't read the file. In most Unix commands, `-` is a convention meaning _read from standard input_ (i.e., the keyboard), so the terminal just waits for you to type something: it's not an error, it's just doing the wrong thing.

> **Tip:** If you get stuck in this state, do **not** press `Esc`. Use **`Ctrl + C`** to interrupt the command and return to the prompt.

---

### Step 4: Read the File Correctly

To read a file whose name is a special character, you need to give the terminal an explicit path to it instead of just the bare name. There are two ways to do this:

**Option A: Use the relative path** _(recommended)_

```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
```

The `./` prefix means _"starting from the current directory"_. This tells `cat` you're referring to a file named `-` in the current directory, not invoking the standard input convention.

**Option B: Use the absolute path**

```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat /home/bandit1/-
```

You can find your current directory at any time with `pwd`. This works, but is slower to type and less portable: `./` is the better habit.

The file contains the password for [Bandit Level 2 → Level 3](bandit-level-2-level-3.md).

---

### Step 5: Save the Password and Exit

> **Warning:** OverTheWire does not remember your progress. Copy the password now with **`Ctrl + Shift + C`** before closing the session.

> **Note:** Per [OverTheWire's rules](https://overthewire.org/rules/), passwords are not published in walkthroughs.

```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ exit
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- A filename of `-` is ambiguous to the shell: always use an explicit path or `./` to reference it.
- `cat -` reads from standard input, not from a file named `-`. This is a Unix convention, not a bug.
- `Ctrl + C` is your escape hatch when a command hangs unexpectedly.
- `./filename` is shorthand for the relative path of a file in your current directory and is generally preferable to typing the full absolute path.
