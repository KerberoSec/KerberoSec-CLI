## What is OverTheWire?

[OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) is a platform that teaches Linux and security concepts through **wargames**, **terminal-based challenges** where you find passwords to unlock the next level. No GUI, no hints, just you and a shell.

Each wargame targets a different skill level and topic, building from basic command-line navigation all the way up to binary exploitation and reverse engineering.

---

## How to Use This Repo

Each wargame has its own folder containing an index and one file per level. Every walkthrough follows the same structure: connection details, commands introduced, a step-by-step solution with explanations, and key takeaways.

**Try the level yourself before opening the walkthrough.** The struggle is where the learning happens.

> **Passwords are never published here**, per [OverTheWire's rules](https://overthewire.org/rules/). The walkthroughs explain *how* to find the password, not what it is.
