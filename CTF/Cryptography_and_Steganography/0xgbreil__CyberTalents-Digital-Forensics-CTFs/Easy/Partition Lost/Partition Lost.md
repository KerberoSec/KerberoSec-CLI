## Initial Analysis
After downloading the file, the `file` command was used:

```bash
file partition-lost.ad1
```

The output shows that it is generic data. However, based on the `.ad1` extension, it is actually a forensic image file (AccessData Logical Image) commonly used to store digital evidence in a structured format.

## Quick Extraction Method

A simple way to retrieve the flag is by using the `strings` command and filtering the output:

```bash
strings partition-lost.ad1 | grep -i flag

```

The flag can be clearly identified in the output.

## Alternative Method

Another approach is to open the file using FTK Imager:

After loading the image, navigate to the root directory where a compressed file named:

`fl@4.rar`

can be found. The flag is located inside this archive.
