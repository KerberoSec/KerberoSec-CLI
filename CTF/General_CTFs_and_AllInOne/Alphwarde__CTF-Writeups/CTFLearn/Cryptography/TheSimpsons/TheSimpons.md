## Solve Time: ~15 mins  

## Challenge Description  
The challenge, **The Simpsons**, involves data decryption through octal and shift ciphers.

## My Approach and Thinking Process  

- Opening the image given in the challenge,

- Nothing here, let's do our standard procedure (`exiftool` and `strings`)

  - After running `strings`, I found this, so I decided to put the octal in CyberChef and it gave me:

  - Decrypting the `key` variable gave me this:

After doing a quick Google search, it turns out that Maggie costs **847.63**, divided by **8** becomes **105.95375**.  
Rounded becomes **106**, and adding **4** results in **`110`**.  

- So, `chr(110)` is **n**  
- Then, `key = key + key + chr(ord(key)-4)`,  
  which means `n + n + (n - 4)`, which is **j**.  
- Key becomes **`nnj`**  

## My Solution  

- Now that we have an encoded text and a key, we have two choices:  
  either **XOR** or **Vigenere cipher**, since it's gibberish.  
  - We can't use **XOR** on octal since we can't turn the key into octal.  

- With **Vigenere cipher**:

  The output was **`wearenumberone`**  

## Flag: `wearenumberone`
