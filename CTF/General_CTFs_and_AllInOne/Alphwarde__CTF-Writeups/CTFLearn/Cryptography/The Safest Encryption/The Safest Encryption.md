# The Safest Encryption: Writeup  
### Solve time: ~20 mins  

## Challenge description  
The challenge, *"The Safest Encryption"*, involves a hidden use of XOR encryption.

**Challenge Prompt**:  
I intercepted this zip file, and the contents seem to be encrypted, but it looks like the key is also inside. Could you try recovering the encrypted file?

- **Zip File**: `CTFLearn.zip`
- **Challenge Difficulty**: Medium
- **Challenge Points**: 40

## My Approach and Thought Process

1. **Initial Inspection**  
   I started by unzipping `CTFLearn.zip`, which revealed two files: `CTFLearn.pdf` and `CTFLearn.txt`.

2. **Checking the Files' Usability**  
   I tried opening both files, but neither worked. I used the `file` command to inspect their formats.

3. **Fixing the File Headers**  
   After checking the files, I suspected that the file headers might be incorrect. I began by fixing the header of the `.pdf` file. The magic bytes for a PDF file should be `25 50 44 46 2D`. 

   Before fixing the header:  
   ![Original PDF Header](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/485c0a8c-5b24-4dc3-85d4-03a563d4da2c)

   After fixing the header:  
   ![Fixed PDF Header](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b32b5f7a-4804-4693-a45d-778605088bc4)

4. **Opening the Fixed PDF**  
   Even after fixing the header, the PDF wouldn’t open. This led me to believe the PDF was either empty or just a red herring in the challenge.

5. **Analyzing the Challenge Name**  
   Given the name of the challenge, I initially thought it could be related to AES encryption, but after testing it with no results, I decided to investigate further using the provided files.

6. **Looking for Clues**  
   I ran `wc` (word count) on both files to check their byte size.

wc CTFLearn.pdf 
113 565 24065 CTFLearn.pdf

wc CTFLearn.txt
79 547 24065 CTFLearn.txt

Both files had the same number of bytes (`24065`), indicating they might be related.

7. **Verifying the Identical Files with `xxd`**  
I ran `xxd` on both files to examine their content. The output showed identical, seemingly random binary data.

## The Solution

Based on my observations, I deduced that the two files were XORed with each other, likely because the encryption key is the same length as the data itself.

### **XOR Decryption Code**

I wrote a simple Python script to XOR the two files together:

```python

file1 = bytearray(open("CTFlearn.pdf", "rb").read())  
file2 = bytearray(open("CTFlearn.txt", "rb").read())  

xord_byte_array = bytearray(len(file1))

for i in range(len(file1)):
 xord_byte_array[i] = file1[i] ^ file2[i]

with open("output.pdf", "wb") as out_file:
 out_file.write(xord_byte_array)

print("done")
```
Result:
- After running the script, I checked the resulting output.pdf and found the flag inside.

- Also after solving it through this script i found a tool called `XORfiles`
